DESCRIPTION	

In ssu.pm's TempFilename() the output directory for all temporary
files was being determined from the summary file name incorrectly. It
was only correctly determined if the output dir did not contain any
subdirectories. This was probably innocuous unless an absolute path to
the output directory was supplied for 'ssu-align', 'ssu-draw',
'ssu-mask' or 'ssu-prep', in which case the program would exit in
error with the cryptic message:
"ERROR, FileOpenForReadingFailure() entered with 4 != 5 input
arguments." 

Here is an SVN diff of the change the fixes the bug. The top line is
the fixed version, the bottom is the ssu-align 0.1 version:
612c613
< 	$out_dir =~ s/\/[^\/]+$/\//; # remove file name
---
> 	$out_dir =~ s/\/.+$/\//; # replace final '/' plus file name with full dir path and final '/'

This bug was fixed as of svn revision 1103. In revision 1104, I
modified the fix slightly so that the file name is stripped by a call
to ReturnDirPath() instead of a substitution via regular expression in
TempFilename().
