\section{Background: alignment using profiles}

\subsection{What is a profile probabilistic model?}

\begin{comment}
Profile probabilistic models are statistical models of a sequence
family that include \emph{position-specific} information about which
residues are 

For our purposes here it is 

Examples include profile hidden Markov models, commonly used
for protein sequence homology search and implemented in some widely
used software packages such as \software{HMMER} (CITE).
