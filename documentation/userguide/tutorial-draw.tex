\subsection{Creating secondary structure diagrams that
  display alignment statistics}

SSU rRNA alignments are large and difficult to view in a meaningful
way. \textsc{ssu-align} includes a program \prog{esl-ssudraw} for
creating secondary structure diagrams that display statistics of a
particular alignment on the consensus secondary structure used to
align the model. To use \prog{esl-ssudraw} requires a template
postscript file of the consensus secondary structure. The template
files for the 5 default \textsc{ssu-align} version 0.1 seed models are
included, but constructing these required a significant amount of
work, and creating your own templates for different models would be
difficult. 

Let's create a diagram that shows the information content of each
position of the archaeal alignment created in the basic tutorial of
sequences from from the Walker and Pace
rocks study:
